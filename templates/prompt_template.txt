You are an expert in exercise form analysis and MediaPipe pose detection. Your task is to generate configuration parameters for a counter that tracks "{{ exercise_name }}" repetitions using MediaPipe pose landmarks.

MediaPipe Pose provides these landmarks:
NOSE, LEFT_EYE_INNER, LEFT_EYE, LEFT_EYE_OUTER, RIGHT_EYE_INNER, RIGHT_EYE, RIGHT_EYE_OUTER, LEFT_EAR, RIGHT_EAR, MOUTH_LEFT, MOUTH_RIGHT, LEFT_SHOULDER, RIGHT_SHOULDER, LEFT_ELBOW, RIGHT_ELBOW, LEFT_WRIST, RIGHT_WRIST, LEFT_PINKY, RIGHT_PINKY, LEFT_INDEX, RIGHT_INDEX, LEFT_THUMB, RIGHT_THUMB, LEFT_HIP, RIGHT_HIP, LEFT_KNEE, RIGHT_KNEE, LEFT_ANKLE, RIGHT_ANKLE, LEFT_HEEL, RIGHT_HEEL, LEFT_FOOT_INDEX, RIGHT_FOOT_INDEX

Available logic types:
- "vertical_movement": Tracks up/down movement of a landmark (for squats, push-ups, etc.)
- "distance_change": Tracks distance changes between two landmarks
- "jumping_jack": Special logic for jumping jacks (tracks wrist-ankle distances)

Direction options:
- "down-first": Exercise starts by moving down (squats, push-ups)
- "up-first": Exercise starts by moving up (bicep curls, jumping jacks)

Generate a JSON configuration with these exact fields:
{
  "class_name": "{{ exercise_name | title | replace(' ', '') }}Counter",
  "logic_type": "vertical_movement",
  "direction": "down-first or up-first",
  "landmark_name": "PRIMARY_LANDMARK_NAME",
  "aux_landmark_name": "AUXILIARY_LANDMARK_NAME or null",
  "min_conf": 0.7,
  "threshold": 0.08,
  "stable_frames": 3,
  "enable_anti_cheat": true,
  "validation_landmarks": ["LANDMARK1", "LANDMARK2", "LANDMARK3"],
  "validation_threshold": 0.03
}

Instructions:
1. Choose the most appropriate primary landmark for tracking the exercise
2. Choose an auxiliary landmark for validation (or null if not needed)
3. Set appropriate threshold (0.05-0.15 typical range)
4. Set stable_frames (2-5 typical range)
5. Choose correct direction based on how the exercise starts
6. For anti-cheat validation, choose 2-4 landmarks that should move in coordination with the primary landmark
7. For push-ups: include shoulders, elbows, hips
8. For squats: include hips, knees, ankles
9. For bicep curls: include shoulders, elbows
10. Set enable_anti_cheat to true for strict form checking, false for simple tracking
11. validation_threshold should be smaller than main threshold (typically 0.02-0.05)

Return ONLY the JSON, no additional text.
